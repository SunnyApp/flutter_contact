## 0.6.1

There shouldn't be any breaking changes, but there are significant changes to how things work under the hood  

* Contacts is duplicated as UnifiedContacts and SingleContacts, to allow access to aggregated contacts, or the raw unlinked contacts
* Parameter `withUnifyInfo` on `getContact` and `getContacts` will produce information about how contacts are linked.  It's more expensive, and therefore disabled by default on `getContacts`
* Removed any java8 dependencies
